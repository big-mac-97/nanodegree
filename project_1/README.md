# nanodegree_project1
Project 1 for Data Science Nanodegree

#### Project Motivation
This project was an investigation into some publicly available AirBnb listing data for Seattle and Boston. The motivation was to develop the basic skills of a data scientist, including communication of code and results. Data was sourced from [this Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data) (for Seattle) and [this Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston/data) (for Boston). I wanted to investigate the pricing trends by suburb and ownership characteristics of different listing types.

#### Requirements
The main Python libraries that have been used are:
- Python 3.8.8
- pandas 1.2.4
- numpy 1.20.1
- matplotlib 3.3.4

#### Files in Repository
Project 1.ipynb - Jupyter notebook containing the analysis of the project
boston_calendar.csv and seattle_calendar.csv - calendar dates for Boston/Seattle listings availability
boston_listings.csv and seattle_listings.csv - comprehensive listing data for all Boston/Seattle listings
boston_reviews.csv and seattle_reviews.csv - extensive review data of Boston/Seattle listings

boston_properties.png and seattle_properties.png - mean count and prices per night by property type in each city
boston_rooms.png and seattle_rooms.png - mean count and prices per night by room type in each city
boston_rooms_dist.png and seattle_rooms_dist.png - price distribution of each room type in each city
