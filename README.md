# nanodegree_project1
Project 1 for Data Science Nanodegree

This project was an investigation into some publicly available AirBnb listing data for Seattle and Boston. The motivation was to develop the basic skills of a data scientist, including communication of code and results.

Files in the repository include the data files themselves. Each is a csv labelled appropriately (the contents are elaborated upon in the Jupyter Notebook which contains the analysis code and its comments).

Analysis was done using Python, primarily with the pandas library. Datetime and matplotlib were used briefly.

Results found that houses and apartments/condos were the most numerous by far. House listings were more expensive both cities by about $10/night. Interestingly, while in Seattle the mean price for an entire home listing was more than double that of a private room, the mean prices were about the same in Boston. Distributions were similar for all types in both cities.

It was found that the majority of hosts had only a single listing. Very few hosts had more than 10 listings, however several hosts with over 100 listings were identified (the largest with 749 listings). It is believed these 'mega-hosts' are either AirBnb management agencies or regular hotel chains listing their rooms on the site, though this cannot be confirmed without more data.

Acknowledgments for other people's code is given next to the lines used.
